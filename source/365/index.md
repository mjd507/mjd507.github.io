受 Facebook 创始人  Mark Zuckerberg 的启发，这里记录每年的个人挑战。

## 2018 （每周一个 TED）

1. [让我们来谈谈死亡](https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_saul_let_s_talk_about_dying) 
2. [我的儿子是校园抢手](https://www.ted.com/talks/sue_klebold_my_son_was_a_columbine_shooter_this_is_my_story)
3. [The mind behind Linux](https://www.ted.com/talks/linus_torvalds_the_mind_behind_linux#t-121539)

   - the understand of open source and how it lead to the development of Linux.
   - git, my second big project
   - I'm not a people person、hellish stubborn
   - the sign of people I really want to work with is that they have good taste
   - I am not a visionary. I do not have a five-year plan. I'm an engineer. And I think it's really -- I mean -- I'm perfectly happy with all the people who are walking around and just staring at the clouds and looking at the stars and saying, "I want to go there." But I'm looking at the ground, and I want to fix the pothole that's right in front of me before I fall in. This is the kind of person I am.
4. [Be humble -- and other lessons from the philosophy of water](https://www.ted.com/talks/raymond_tang_be_humble_and_other_lessons_from_the_philosophy_of_water)


   - The first lesson is about humility. instead of acting like I know what I'm doing or I have all the answers, it's perfectly OK to say, "I don't know. I want to learn more, and I need your help.
   - The second lesson I learned is about harmony. stopped fighting with myself, and learned to work with my environment to solve its problems.
   - The third lesson I learned from the philosophy of water is about openness. We can no longer expect to work to a static job description or follow a single career path. We, too, are expected to constantly reinvent and refresh our skills to stay relevant.
5. [Teach girls bravery, not perfection](https://www.ted.com/talks/reshma_saujani_teach_girls_bravery_not_perfection)
