use DeepSeek for one week, omg, really powerful for our tech guys.

Every answer exceeded my expectations and I could easily access and understand details that I didn't know before or would have taken me a lot of time to know,  now with deep seek, I feel like I have the world at my fingertips.

List one example I asked to DeepSeek.

Q: Spring Boot startup flow

here are the full output from DeepSeek.

The Spring Boot application startup flow follows a specific sequence to initialize the application context, load configurations, and start the embedded server. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

---

### **1. Entry Point: `main()` Method**
The application starts from the `main` method, which calls `SpringApplication.run()`:
```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApp {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args);
  }
}
```

---

### **2. Initialize `SpringApplication`**
- **Loads Defaults**: Configures default settings (e.g., banner, logging).
- **Infers Application Type**: Determines if it’s a web application (Servlet, Reactive, or non-web).
- **Loads `ApplicationContextInitializer`s**: Customizes the context before it’s refreshed.
- **Loads `ApplicationListener`s**: Listens to Spring Boot events (e.g., `ApplicationStartingEvent`).

---

### **3. Prepare the Environment**
- **Load Properties**: Reads `application.properties`, `application.yml`, and profiles (e.g., `@Profile`).
- **Set Active Profiles**: Configures environments (e.g., `dev`, `prod`).

---

### **4. Create `ApplicationContext`**
- **Web Apps**: Uses `AnnotationConfigServletWebServerApplicationContext`.
- **Non-Web Apps**: Uses `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext`.

---

### **5. Run `ApplicationContext`**
- **Component Scanning**: Scans packages for `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, etc.
- **Process `@Configuration` Classes**: Loads beans defined in configuration classes.
- **Auto-Configuration**: Enabled via `@EnableAutoConfiguration` (part of `@SpringBootApplication`):
  - Checks classpath dependencies (e.g., `spring-boot-starter-web`).
  - Configures beans automatically (e.g., `DataSource`, `JdbcTemplate`).

---

### **6. Execute `CommandLineRunner`/`ApplicationRunner`**
Runs custom logic after the context is loaded but before the app fully starts:
```java
@Bean
public CommandLineRunner demo() {
  return args -> System.out.println("App started!");
}
```

---

### **7. Start Embedded Web Server**
- **Tomcat/Jetty/Undertow**: Starts automatically for web applications.
- **Port Configuration**: Listens on the specified port (default: `8080`).

---

### **8. Application Ready**
- Publishes `ApplicationReadyEvent`.
- The app is now ready to handle HTTP requests (if applicable).

---

### **Key Annotations**
- `@SpringBootApplication`: Combines `@Configuration`, `@ComponentScan`, and `@EnableAutoConfiguration`.
- `@ConditionalOnClass`: Drives auto-configuration based on classpath dependencies.

---

### **Flow Summary**
```
main() → SpringApplication.run()
  → Environment Setup
  → ApplicationContext Creation
  → Component Scan & Auto-Configuration
  → Run CommandLineRunner/ApplicationRunner
  → Start Embedded Server
  → Application Ready
```

This streamlined flow allows Spring Boot to "just work" with minimal configuration while providing hooks for customization.
