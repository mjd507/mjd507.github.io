> Sunday's coming I wanna drive my car
> 
> To your apartment with the present like a star
> 
> Forecaster said the weathers may be rainy hard
> 
> But I know the sun will shine for us
> 
> Oh lazy seagull fly me from the dark
> 
> I dress my jeans and feed my monkey banana
> 
> Then I think my age how old. skyline how far
> 
> We need each other in California
> 
> You show me your body before night comes down
> 
> I touch your face and promise to stay ever young
> 
> On this ivory beach we kissed so long
> 
> It seems that the passion's never gone
> 
> You sing me your melody and I feel so please
> 
> I want you to want me to keep your dream
> 
> Together we'll run wild by a summer symphony
> 
> This is what we enjoyed not a fantasy


> The tin-man's surfing I wanna try my luckP
> 
> To the top of tide rip like just have some drugs
> 
> I know you have no blame for my proud moonish heart
> 
> Welcome to the golden beatnic park
> 
> Oh diamond seashore drag me from the yard
> 
> Incredible sunward I watch as you're in photograph
> 
> For camera your smile's so sweet. palm tree's so lush
> 
> Would you believe my honey It's California
> 
> You show me your body before night comes down
> 
> I touch your face and promise to stay ever young
> 
> On this ivory beach we kissed so long
> 
> It seems that the passion's never gone
> 
> You sing me your melody and I feel so please
