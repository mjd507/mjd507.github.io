I was woken up in the middle of night by my wife kicking me. 

<!--more-->

yesterday, we had a fight again. actually we had a lot of figths recentlly, all about money.

we have no house, and keep saving money month by month, hoping to buy a house in Shanghai, it's really tough but I really enjoy the process of increasing the amount of money in our account.

but recentlly, we have a lot of unnecessary expenses that makes me very upset.

my wife also has two little brothers, and all going to get married now. 

when I got married, my family bought a car for us, and when one of her big brother try to get married in the National Day, we drove our car to her home, and leave it in her home due to we need to fly to his brother's girlfriend's home, and finally we fly to Shanghai, and never touch our car. 

now our new car is dirven by his younger brother day by day, using my etc account, and I feel so angry and hope my wife to say to her brother to get our car back. but she said impossible. I look the car info from my phone, 30 days 3000km and keep increasing.

the other thing is her bigger brother will host a wedding in the next year begin, her smaller brother will also prepare for engagement in the same time. and her mother call her to give some money implicitly, we already lend money to his samll brother to buy his own car, I don't want to give anymore.

some other things I don't want to mention right now.

we fight a lot, we have nothing, her younger brother, own his house and car by borrowing money from each other.

and this year, my wife try to give her parent a big amount money each one, my heart broken again.

4 o'clock in the morning, What a bad life.
